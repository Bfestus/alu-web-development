# HTML ADVANCED

Welcome to the ALU Web Development Project, where we explore the world of Advanced HTML! This project takes your HTML skills to the next level by introducing advanced features that empower you to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

## What is Advanced HTML?

Advanced HTML is a powerful toolkit of features that extend beyond the basics of HTML syntax. It empowers you to craft web pages that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional, offering an enhanced user experience. Let's delve into some key aspects of Advanced HTML:

### 1. Semantic Markup
In the world of Advanced HTML, we embrace the concept of Semantic Markup. This means using HTML elements like:
```header```, ```<nav>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, and ```<footer>```.
 to provide meaningful structure to your content. By doing so, you not only make your code cleaner but also improve accessibility and SEO. Here's an example:

```html
<header>
    
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    
    <nav>
    
        <ul>
    
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
    
          <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    
        </ul>
    
    </nav>
    
    </header>

    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>Article content goes here.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>```


### 2. Multimedia Integration

With Advanced HTML, integrating multimedia elements like images, audio, video, and even animations becomes a breeze. HTML5 brought native support for ```<video>``` and ```<audio>``` tags, reducing the need for third-party plugins. Here's a glimpse:

``` html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>

<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>

<svg width="200" height="200">
    <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>

```

### 3. Forms and Input Handling
Advanced HTML offers enhanced control over forms and input elements. You can use various input types and attributes for validation, making your web forms more interactive and user-friendly:

```html
<form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" required>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" required>

    <label for="message">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="message" required></textarea>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>```

### 4. Canvas and SVG Graphics

HTML5 introduced the ```<canvas>``` element for dynamic graphics and animations using JavaScript. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can also be embedded for resolution-independent vector graphics:
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
```

### 5. Accessibility Considerations

Advanced HTML places a strong emphasis on accessibility. By using proper semantic elements, providing alternative text for images, using appropriate headings, and adhering to accessibility standards, you ensure that your websites are usable and inclusive for all users
